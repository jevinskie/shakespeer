sphubd:
-------

* increase priority for UI connections?
* verify reconnection with password

! MUST send client connected status, even if no transfer is taking place

Low(er) priority:

* fix transfer-stats when uploading the same file to two or more users
* detect and handle hub redirection loops
* make extip_detect asynchronous
* check TTH on downloaded files
* configurable number of download slots (now unlimited)
* report (total) up/download statistics continuously
* parse $HubTopic commands
* remember timestamps on chat messages

Propably won't happen any time soon:

? same user with different shares on multiple hubs (http://shakespeer.tweakbase.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=285)
* automatic multiple-sources concurrent downloads using tths


sphashd:
--------



gui:
----

* Merge queue menu item "Search for alternates" and "Search by TTH"
  - check what to do based on existence of a TTH
* Add "Grant extra slot" menu items to queue and transfer menus
* Remove 'Keep backend running in background' option
* Add Filemenu item "Quit but keep backend running"
* kill -TERM/-KILL sphubd + sphashd if not gone after shutdown

* rework download queue / transfer lists
  - rename to Downloads
  - remove finished transfers (keep them greyed out in the dl queue instead)
  - add command to remove completed transfers from the download (as in soulseeX)

  - replace Transfers view with Uploads

* Tab completion on nicknames in main chat
? Menu option to download to separate location
  + pre-defined locations (music, movies, etc...)
* implement user-command commands in filelist view
* ability to see stats in bottom of main window (#1294025)

* Filter kick messages from main chat
* Add menu item to download file and open in TextEdit (Search view, Filelist view)

* away mode + prefs

graphical glitches (low priority):

* Fix string truncation in filelist view
